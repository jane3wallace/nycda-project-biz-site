						About Us
					</h1>
					<p>
						We invite you to Roscoe's Bakery in the city of West Hills, CA to try fresh baked goods, prepared on the premises, using only the best ingredients.
					</p>
					<p>
				        We specialize in creative and delicious cakes for any occasion: Weddings, Birthdays, Anniversaries, Sweet 16, Quinceaneras and Baby Showers. Bring in your idea or a picture and our chefs will create the cake you will love and enjoy.
			    	</p>
			        <p>
				        Our bakers and pastry chefs strive to make our customers happy and satisfied and we ask that you always feel free to give us your feedback.
	        		</p>
	        		<p>
	        			If you are looking for something more than a traditional cake, something that will be the center of attention at your next event, look no further than our custom cakes. A custom cake is a great way to display an honored guest's personality and can be designed to highlight their interests, creativity or past times. We'll help you design your custom cake and all of our cakes are made from scratch so we deliver great taste to compliment the design. 
	        		</p>
	        		<p>
	        			How about a kid's birthday? Our team at Roscoe's Bakery absolutely loves when kids greet our cakes with excitement and huge smiles. That is why we pay special attention to the quality and decor of their cakes. Just tell us what your kids' interests are and we will help you design a memorable cake.
	        		</p>
	        		<p>
	        			Looking for a wedding cake? Your wedding day is one of the most important and joyful days of your life. Our talented and creative pastry chefs will work with you personally to find the perfect design and flavors for your wedding cake.
	        		</p>
	        		<p>
						Please call us if you would like to schedule a cake tasting and consultation. During the consultation we will happily provide you with different ideas and options for designs, flavors, colors, special details and pricing. Of course feel free to bring in your own designs and we will do our best to create the custom wedding cake you've been dreaming about!
