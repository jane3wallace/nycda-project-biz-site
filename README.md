# NYCDA WD Collaborative Business Website
A project that I collaborated on with classmate Roscoe Coney during my New York Code + Design Academy Web Dev 100 class in Philly after Week 5 Lecture 2. This project was to build a responsive 3 page website for a business that included an image gallery. I created the landing page and about page, the layout, navigation and color scheme. I also utilized Google Map and FitText jQuery plugins.

### Assignment:
* Get in pairs.

* Choose a business to build a full-featured website for or create a fictitious business.

* Before you even begin coding, sketch out what you'd like the website to look like and discuss who will handle each aspect of the site

* Using Git + GitHub is optional, but you are more then welcome to use it to collaborate with your group members with your instructor's help

* Site requirements:
  * At least 3 separate pages
  * Make a responsive image gallery
  * Optional: Use jQuery and JavaScript for interaction
